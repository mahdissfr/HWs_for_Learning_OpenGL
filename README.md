In GHW1 (Graphic Homework1):
	In this program, a rectangle is created on the screen first.
This window should be able to resize the content (including the background and the rectangle) and after resizing the page, the position of the rectangular corners relative to the corners of the page should be maintained.
In this program:
 - you can move the mouse cursor to any corner of the rectangle and after clicking and holding the mouse button, you can change the position of the rectangle's vertex (the mouse moves with the vertex) and with Releasing the mouse, the vertex of the rectangle remains in the same position.
 - Each time you press the Space key, the way the rectangle is displayed changes from Wireframe to Fill and from Fill to Wireframe.

In GHW2 (Graphic Homework2):
	In this exercise, we display a simple rectangle with color and texture on its surface and change the direction and shape of the rectangle through the keyboard input.
	Each corner of this rectangle must be a color created by the Fragment Shader. This color should be on the texture image. The color of the corners of this rectangle should change as desired by rotating it.
